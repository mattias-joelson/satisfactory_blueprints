# Ideas

Things to test out in Satisfactory and probably build a base around.

## Hexagons

Use hexagons instead of squares as basis of production floor.

## Train Stations Underneath

Let all the train stations enter below production grid. Even more verticality.

## Production Grid Extends to Ground

The whole production grid will be box hiding supporting pillars. What is needed to make the texture interesting?

## How to Encapsulate Production Modules

Encapsulate the production grid is simple, but how to decorate the production modules?

## Use Larger Blueprints

Is it possible to stamp out a bigger factory simpler by using mk2 and mk3 blueprints. If one use mk5 blueprints,
is it possible to add the production grid pillar and connections as well?

## Go All in On Alternate Recipes

What can be done?

## Get Through Satisfactory+

Go all in on that mod.

## A new look.
Use unpainted machines and parts everywhere.
